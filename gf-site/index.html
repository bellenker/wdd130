            <h1>Going Gluten-Free</h1>
            <p>What does that mean? To go gluten-free means to remove all wheat, rye, or barley products from your diet. These three grains contain a protein called gluten. There are many reasons why people eat gluten-free. One of the main reasons is that your doctor tells you to eat gluten-free due to a condition called Celiac Disease or something else. This condition is not a disease in the normal sense of the word. It cannot be cured by medicine or other means, and you won't be able to get rid of it.

            <p>When told to eat gluten-free, you feel like your world has come to an end. What do you eat? You can't eat anything that uses flour, bread, noodles, muffins, most quick foods, or anything that has touched any of these items. Going out is next to impossible. Is all you have left salads? No worries my meal ideas page can help you with this issue and give you ideas for other meal ideas.
