      <h2>Going Gluten-Free</h2>
      <p>
        What does that mean? To go gluten-free means to remove all wheat, rye, or barley products from your diet. These three grains contain a protein called gluten. There are many reasons why people eat gluten-free. One of the main reasons is that your doctor tells you to eat gluten-free due to a condition called Celiac Disease or something else. This condition is not a disease in the normal sense of the word. It cannot be cured by medicine or other means, and you won't be able to get rid of it.

        When told to eat gluten-free you feel like your world has come to an end. What do you eat? You can't eat anything that uses flour, bread, noodles, muffins, most quick foods, or anything that has touched any of these items. Going out is next to impossible. Is all you have left salads? No worries my meal ideas page can help you with this issue and give you ideas for other meal ideas.

        Now simple things like going shopping, going out to eat, attending public functions, and anything involved with food has presented a problem and now you need to think twice about what to do. No worries, the information page will go over simple things you can do to help you enjoy events and shop without fear.

      <h3>Meal Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        There are many foods that are naturally gluten-free. Fruits, vegetables, dairy, nuts, meat, and sugars are all naturally gluten-free. The only reason foods obtain gluten is because sauces, seasonings, items and toppings added to food recipes contains gluten. This makes it a bit harder to find things ready made to eat. Lets go over some ideas that can help you make meals that are gluten-free.

        Snacks are the fastest and easiest way to get nutrition into the body. Some gluten-free snacks include corn chips, yogurt, cheese curds or slices, plain or salted nuts, plain flavor ice cream, veggie and fruit slices, and products labeled gluten-free for just a few ideas.
        
        There are many hot and cold meals that can be made that are gluten-free. Baked potatoes with vaious toppings is one of them. A few other meal ideas are: baked meats with a side of green beans and sour cream potatoes with cheese; eggs boiled, fried, or scrambled; rice topped, mixed, or as a side to a dish; cereal labelled gluten-free; homemade potato salad, chicken salad, and orther types of salads; and other recipes. 
        
        There are many websites that have recipes and other ideas to create gluten-free meals.

      <h3>Need To Know</h3>
      <p>
        It can feel daunting to go shopping or go out when you need to find or obtain food to eat. Here are a few things you need to know to keep yourself safe and eating gluten-free. 

        There are official gluten-free symbols that are placed on labels to indicate the recipe used to make the product is gluten-free. If you see these symbols you can be pretty sure that what you are buying is gluten-free. However, if it doesn't have a written statement of gluten-free with the symbol it is best to look at the nutritional information and ingredients to confirm if something is gluten-free or not. 

        When shopping, the labels on the products are your best friend. Even if a product doesn't have the gluten-free certification symbol that doesn't mean it isn't gluten-free. Having the certification put on the label costs quite a bit of money and raises the price of the product. Unless the company sells so many products that the cost across their products may amount to a penny in price when the certification is added, most companies can't afford to become certified. So, they take a different approach. 
        
        It is standard FDA rules that the ingredients that exist in a product must be listed and any allergies or potentially harmful ingredients must be listed on the label. Most of these ingredients can be found under the "Contains" field. When a product doesn't list a contains field there are only a few words you need to look for with in the ingredients list. They are: modified food starch, wheat, flour, malt, rye, gluten, and barley.
        
        Everyone likes to eat out once and a while. There are times when we are strapped for time. For people who can't eat gluten, eating out becomes a battle between choosing to eat and going to the hospital or starve. Many fast food places are aware of the difficulties people who need to eat gluten-free face. Most places have gluten-free options and menus. Just asking a place if they have gluten-free options is usually all you need to do to get to eat out. When you start and are learning to eat gluten-free it is not recommended to eat out anywhere that does not have gluten-free options or a menu. Don't worry, no one needs to starve.  Have fun!
