        <h1>Need To Know</h1>
        <p>It can feel daunting to go shopping or go out when you need to find or obtain food to eat. Here are a few things you need to know to keep yourself safe and eating gluten-free. 
        </p>
        <p>There are official gluten-free symbols that are placed on labels, to indicate the recipe used to make the product is gluten-free. If you see these symbols you can be pretty sure that what you are buying is gluten-free. However, if it doesn't have a written statement of gluten-free with the symbol it is best to look at the nutritional information and ingredients on the label to confirm if something is gluten-free or not. 
        </p>
        <div class="label">
        <img class="label-1" src="images/label.jpg" alt="image for page3">
        <img class="label-2" src="images/wheat label.jpeg" alt="image for page3">
        <p>When shopping, the labels on the products are your best friend. Even if a product doesn't have the gluten-free certification symbol that doesn't mean it isn't gluten-free. Having the certification put on the label costs quite a bit of money and raises the price of the product. Unless the company sells so many products that the cost across their products may amount to a penny in price when the certification is added, most companies can't afford to become certified. So, they take a different approach. 
        </p>    
        <p>It is standard FDA rules that the ingredients that exist in a product must be listed and any allergies or potentially harmful ingredients must be listed on the label. Most of these ingredients can be found under the "Contains" field. When a product doesn't list a contains field there are only a few words you need to look for with in the ingredients list. They are: modified food starch, wheat, flour, malt, rye, gluten, and barley.

        <p>Everyone likes to eat out once and a while. There are times when we are strapped for time. For people who can't eat gluten, eating out becomes a battle between choosing to eat and going to the hospital or starve. Many fast food places are aware of the difficulties people who need to eat gluten-free face. Most places have gluten-free options and menus. Just asking a place if they have gluten-free options is usually all you need to do to get to eat out. When you start and are learning to eat gluten-free it is not recommended to eat out anywhere that does not have gluten-free options or a menu. Don't worry, no one needs to starve.  Have fun!
